A Single Page Application in React

For this assignment i was required to build a Single Page Application in React. This assignment examines my understanding of the core React concepts:  functional components, props and state.  

As always the choice of content and design was up to me, but it had to consist of 3 "pages". No routing should be used in this assignment, I would use state to mock routing.
